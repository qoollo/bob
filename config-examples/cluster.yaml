# [time] is a concatenation of spans. Where each span is an integer number and a suffix.
# E.g.: [1y 2M 4w 8d 16h 32min 64s 128ms 256us]
# Some supported suffixes:
#  msec, ms -- milliseconds
#  seconds, second, sec, s
#  minutes, minute, min, m
#  hours, hour, hr, h

# [list] of all cluster nodes
nodes:
      # [str] node name
    - name: local_node
      # [ip:port] node address
      address: 127.0.0.1:20000
      # [list] of physical node disks
      disks:
          # [str] name of disk, the node uses it to determine which vdisks belong to it
        - name: disk1
          # [str] mount point, it doesn't matter if it is a whole physical disk or a directory
          path: /tmp/d1

# [list] of all cluster vdisks
vdisks:
      # [uint] unique vdisk identifier
    - id: 0
      # [list] of vdisk replicas locations
      replicas:
          #[str] node name, to find target node in nodes list 
        - node: local_node
          #[str] disk name, to find location of the replica on the node in disks list
          disk: disk1

# Number of errors that will lead to node be considered disconnected
